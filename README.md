# CST8221-Java-Application-Programming

In this course we used Java to learn and develop applications using swing or JavaFX technologies for graphical user interfaces.
We also learned how to build using OOP design patterns, networking, multithreaded and multi-tiered applications.

# Calculator GUI
- Developed a functioning calculator using the MVC(Model View Controller) design pattern that works and interacts similarly to the Windows calculator program.

# Client and Server Chat GUI
- Developed a socket based multi threaded client-to-server chat application.
- Implemented a Runnable interface to have the applications run concurrently together.
